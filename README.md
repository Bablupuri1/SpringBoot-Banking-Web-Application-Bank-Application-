## 💡 My Learning Experience
While building this project, I learned:
- 🔹 Real-world flow where **only Admin can open accounts** (no self-registration).  
- 🔹 Handling **transactions & rollback** using `@Transactional`.  
- 🔹 Designing **database relations**: Customer ↔ Account ↔ Transaction.  
- 🔹 Implementing **role-based panels** (User vs Admin).  
- 🔹 Adding **reporting features** for successful vs failed transactions.  
- 🔹 Generating **Downloadable Statements** (All / Date Range).  
- 🔹 Integrating **Email Notifications** for account creation & transactions.  
- 🔹 Writing **clean, modular, and maintainable code**.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
